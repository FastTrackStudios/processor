//! A rack unit's front panel, as data.
//!
//! Every emulated unit shares one anatomy: a painted panel with rack ears, a
//! meter somewhere on the left, a row of knobs with silkscreened legends, and
//! the occasional switch or bank of buttons. Hand-writing each one as its own
//! component produces near-identical files that drift apart in spacing and
//! colour, so a face is a [`RackDesign`] — a table of placements.
//!
//! The *drawing* of a design lives in the plugin, because that is where the
//! controls' handles come from: a design names controls by id, and only the
//! plugin knows how to turn an id into a [`ParamHandle`](crate::ParamHandle)
//! through its own profile data. The description lives here so the compressor
//! and the EQ describe their panels in the same vocabulary.
