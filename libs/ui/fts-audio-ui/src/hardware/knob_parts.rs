/// 2. the *anisotropy* — a turned face throws two bright lobes opposite each
///    other and goes dark ninety degrees away, and that is what says metal;
/// 3. the turning marks. Concentric, because a knob cap is faced on a lathe
///    that spins it: the marks go round, not out. Drawn as conic spokes they
///    converge at the hub and the cap reads as a paper fan — which is what
///    happened, twice: four fat spokes made a pinwheel, and thirty-six fine
///    ones made a sunburst;
/// 4. the metal itself. Anodised aluminium, not chrome: an outboard knob is
///    darker than the white index line printed on it, or the line disappears.
