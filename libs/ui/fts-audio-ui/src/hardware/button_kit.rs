//! What a panel button is *made of*, as data.
//!
//! The third kit, after [`knob_kit`](crate::hardware::knob_kit) and
//! [`vu_kit`](crate::hardware::vu_kit), and the same bargain: one
//! [`ButtonSpec`] const per part, and a renderer that walks it without
//! knowing which unit it is drawing.
//!
//! Before this, a button was one drawing with a colour prop. The faces asked
//! for fourteen different colours and got fourteen recolours of the same
//! part — which is not what tells an 1176's ratio button from an SSL's
//! illuminated square. The *shape* is: whether the cap lights from within or
//! has a jewel under it, whether it sits in a bezel, how far it travels.
//!
//! # Adding a button
//!
//! Add a [`ButtonStyle`](crate::hardware::button::ButtonStyle) variant and one
//! `ButtonSpec` in [`button_parts`](crate::hardware::button_parts). Then look
//! at it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p fts-audio-ui --test button_sheet
//! ```
//!
//! which paints every button in the kit, up and down, wired and unwired.
//!
//! Sizes here are **design px**, scaled by the panel like every other
//! dimension in this crate — not fractions of the cap.
//!
//! That is deliberate and was learned the hard way: a legend is a type size, a
//! throw is a distance, a corner radius is a radius. They are properties of
//! the *part*, not proportions of whatever box a face asks for. Expressed as
//! fractions, a face that wanted a short wide button (comp-ui asks for 40x22)
//! got a legend scaled down with the height until it was unreadable.
