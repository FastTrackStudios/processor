//! What a VU movement *looks like*, as data.
//!
//! The companion to [`knob_kit`](crate::hardware::knob_kit), and the same
//! bargain: geometry lives in [`vu_svg`](crate::hardware::vu_svg) as pure
//! functions, the *drawing* is one [`VuSpec`] const per face, and the
//! renderer walks it without knowing which unit it is painting.
//!
//! A meter is a printed card behind glass, lit from behind by a bulb or two,
//! with a needle swinging over it and — if it is mounted through the panel
//! rather than printed on one — a bezel around it. Everything a theme wants
//! to move is one of those.
//!
//! # Adding a face
//!
//! Add a [`VuFace`](crate::hardware::vu::VuFace) variant and one `VuSpec`
//! in [`vu_faces`](crate::hardware::vu_faces). Then look at it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p fts-audio-ui --test vu_sheet
//! ```
//!
//! which paints every face in the kit, at rest and swinging, with and without
//! its bezel.
//!
//! # What is *not* a theme
//!
//! The card's numbers and where they sit. A VU is crowded at the bottom and a
//! decibel readout is evenly spaced, and that is the difference between two
//! *instruments*, not two colour schemes — so it stays in
//! [`VuScale`](crate::hardware::vu_svg::VuScale) where the geometry can test
//! it. A face says how the meter is lit and printed; a scale says what it
//! reads.
