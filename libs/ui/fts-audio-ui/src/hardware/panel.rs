//! [`Panel`] is the root of a hardware face: it measures the editor window,
//! works out the [`fit_scale`](crate::hardware::panel_svg::fit_scale) for its
//! design size, and hands that factor to its children, which multiply their
//! own pixel sizes by it. Nothing on a panel reflows — the drawing is fixed
//! and only its size changes, which is what keeps it reading as one object.
//!
//! The window size comes from the reactive `Signal<(u32, u32)>` that
//! `nice-plug-dioxus` puts in context on resize. It is absent in the headless
//! test harness and in any non-plugin mount, so the panel falls back to its
//! design size and draws unscaled.
