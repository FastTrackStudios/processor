//! A hardware knob — pointer, skirt, and a scale ring printed on the panel.
//!
//! Different from [`fts_audio_ui::Knob`] in the way that matters: an FTS knob
//! draws its value as an arc, because the value is the point. A hardware knob
//! draws a *pointer*, and the value is read off numbers silkscreened on the
//! panel around it — which is why the ring here is drawn even where the
//! pointer is not, and why the numbers are the unit's own (LA-2A GAIN reads
//! 0–10, 1176 INPUT reads -48…+12) rather than the engine's.
//!
//! Geometry lives in [`crate::hardware::knob_svg`]. Dragging goes through the
//! same [`DragProvider`](fts_audio_ui::drag::DragProvider) as every other FTS
//! control, so a hardware face behaves like the rest of the editor.

/// These are the actual knobs the units wear, because the shape is most of
/// what you recognise a panel by before you read a word of it:
///
/// - **Daka-Ware** (Pultec EQP-1A): black phenolic, a 1⅛" ridged body sitting
///   on a 1½" skirt — so the skirt is a third wider than the grip — with the
///   indicator *engraved into the body and filled white* rather than moulded
///   as a pointer.
/// - **Marconi** (Neve 1073, and the 1081/1272): a coloured two-piece knob
///   whose body carries a raised wing to grip, over a wider skirt, with a
///   white line down the wing. Neve's colour coding rides on these — red gain,
///   blue filters, grey shelf.
/// - **Collet** (SSL 4000 channel): a flat-topped coloured cap with a fluted
///   rim and a single white bar across the top. No skirt: the panel prints the
///   travel as dots around it instead.
/// - **Silver-top** (UREI 1176): a wide matte black collar with a *brushed,
///   knurled aluminium cap* set into the middle of it, and the index a white
///   line on the **collar** — outside the cap, not across it. That is the
///   arrangement that makes an 1176's knobs read as rings from across a room:
///   a dark annulus around a bright disc. INPUT and OUTPUT take the large
///   one, ATTACK and RELEASE the small.
