//! The furniture a time-domain effect panel draws under everything else.
//!
//! A delay and a reverb are different pictures, but they are read the same
//! way: a lane of time running left to right, ruled by the tempo, in the
//! colour of whichever effect owns it. That common half lives here rather
//! than once per effect crate, so the two cannot drift about what a beat
//! line looks like — a grid that disagreed between two panels in the same
//! rack would read as one of them being wrong about the tempo.
