//! Editor form factors — the preset window sizes a plugin can wear.
//!
//! A face is a fixed drawing, so "what size is this editor" is a real choice
//! rather than a slider: an outboard unit has a size, and an FTS plugin should
//! be able to claim the same ones. The vocabulary and the ratios come from
//! `audio_controls::core::layout::FormFactor`, which laid this out first (19"
//! rack at 482 x 44.45 mm per U, a 500-series module at 38 x 133 mm); this is
//! that table as *editor* sizes, plus the rule for what a face does when its
//! drawing cannot fit the box.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Every form is available to every face. What changes is how the face draws
//! itself: while the panel fits at a legible scale it is drawn as the panel,
//! and when it cannot — a 500-series module is portrait, and no 3:1 rack
//! drawing goes in there — the face flows its controls into the space instead
//! ([`EditorForm::wants_panel`]). One drawing, two renderings, so a new unit
//! gets the narrow sizes for free rather than needing a second layout table.

/// A preset editor size.

/// Persisted by [`id`](EditorForm::id), never by index — see the note on the
