//! A drag has to survive the pointer leaving the control.

//! Blitz has no pointer capture: it hit-tests every move and dispatches to
//! whatever is under the cursor. [`DragProvider`] is the answer — it wraps
//! the editor root, so a move anywhere in the window bubbles to it and
//! reaches whichever widget started the drag. These tests are that claim,
//! stated: press a knob, move the pointer somewhere else entirely, and the
//! parameter must still follow.
