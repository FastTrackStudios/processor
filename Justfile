# On macOS this uses nice-plug-xtask's `bundle-universal` instead of
# `bundle`: it builds both aarch64-apple-darwin and x86_64-apple-darwin and
# lipo's them into one universal .clap/.vst3 per plugin — no custom lipo
# scripting needed. Requires the x86_64-apple-darwin rustc target (added to
# fts.rustToolchain for darwin — nix/modules/toolchain.nix).

# Prove every bundle in target/bundled actually LOADS — dlopen it, run its
# entry point, and walk its factory (apps/plugins/verify/). A plugin that
# compiles, links, and exports the right symbol can still fail in a host: a
# missing dependency or a panicking init only shows up at load time, and
# `nm` cannot see either.
#
# Works on both platforms, including their different bundle shapes (Linux
# .clap is a bare shared object, macOS .clap is a directory) and different
# VST3 entry-point names (ModuleEntry vs bundleEntry). On macOS, pass an
# arch to run the universal binaries in one personality:
#   just plugins-verify              # native
#   just plugins-verify x86_64       # the Intel half, under Rosetta
