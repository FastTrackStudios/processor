//! A picture per modulation engine, rather than one sine for all six.
//!
//! The panel drew the same LFO whatever was loaded, which says only "something
//! is wobbling at this rate". But a chorus and a phaser at identical rate and
//! depth do entirely different things to a signal, and the point of a
//! visualiser is to tell them apart — so each engine draws what it actually
//! does:
//!
//! | engine | what it is | what it draws |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Chorus | detuned copies around the dry | voices weaving apart and back together |
//! | Flanger | comb filter, swept | the comb, its teeth sliding |
//! | Phaser | allpass notches, swept | notches travelling through a band |
//! | Tremolo | amplitude modulation | a waveform pumping in level |
//! | Vibrato | pitch modulation | a waveform stretching and compressing |
//! | Rotary | a speaker going round | the orbit, and the doppler it makes |
//!
//! Modulation is cyan-led and motion pink-led, so which of the two groups you
//! are reading is answerable without going to the label.
