//! What the compressor is actually doing, painted — data in, nothing else.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate component from [`CompGraph`]
//!
//! [`CompGraph`](crate::comp_graph::CompGraph) is the plugin's editor: it
//! reads `SharedState` and the editor's `ParamContext` out of context, edits
//! parameters through `ParamPtr`, and owns the drag gestures. All of that is
//! correct inside the plugin and impossible outside it — a rig remote has no
//! parameter tree, and a channel strip embedding one compressor among twenty
//! has no business inheriting the plugin's context.
//!
//! So the *picture* is split from the *editing*, the way `eq-ui` already
//! splits `EqGraph` (bands in, band events out) from the plugin that binds it
//! to parameters. [`CompView`] is the whole of what the picture needs, and
//! [`CompViz`] takes it as props. The plugin keeps its gestures and hands the
//! same numbers down; anything else — the rig, a strip, a detached surface —
//! mounts this directly.
//!
//! The transfer maths is NOT re-derived here: it is
//! [`compress_transfer`](crate::comp_graph_svg::compress_transfer), the same
//! function the SVG path and the plugin's curve use. A second copy that drew
//! a slightly different knee would be worse than no picture, because it would
//! be believed.
