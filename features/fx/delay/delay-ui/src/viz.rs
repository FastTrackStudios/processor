//! What the delay is actually doing, painted.
//!
//! This panel was knobs and a number. A delay's character is its taps — where
//! they land against the beat, how fast they give up, whether they walk across
//! the stereo field — and none of that is legible from `TIME 0.42 · FB 0.28`.
//! The picture's whole job is that a quarter-note delay is one you can *see*
//! is a quarter note, because its taps sit on the gridlines.
//!
//! # Two painters, one widget
//!
//! [`Widget::paint`] records into an `anyrender::Scene` — a command list, not
//! a wgpu call — so whatever can replay it can draw this: the GPU backend, the
//! CPU one, and a canvas in a browser. That is the **fallback**, and it is not
//! a poor relation: vello rasterises it with real gradients and blurs.
//!
//! The **shader** path is the escape hatch the widget trait describes: take
//! the device in [`Widget::can_create_surfaces`], render WGSL into a texture,
//! and hand the scene that texture's id. It is asked for per frame rather than
//! decided per build, so a renderer that cannot do it simply gets the vectors.
//!
//! # Not a signal, a cell
//!
//! Paint happens inside Blitz's traversal, which is not the Dioxus runtime;
//! reading a `Signal` there is a panic waiting for the first frame that takes
//! a different path. What this needs is a handful of numbers, and numbers can
//! live in a `RefCell` the component writes and the widget reads.
