//! The EQ's light: the analyser as a field, and a bloom under every band.
//!
//! # Why a shader and not more vectors
//!
//! The graph's geometry is read precisely — a curve says what the filter does,
//! a grid line says where 1 kHz is, a node ring says where to grab. Vectors are
//! right for all of it, and a shader would only make a 1 px line worse.
//!
//! What vectors are wrong for is everything that should look like *energy*:
//! the analyser's body, the spill where a band is loud, the halo that says
//! which node has focus. Those want the thing light actually does — falling
//! off smoothly, adding where it overlaps, blowing out toward white — and
//! approximating that with stacked translucent paths costs both fidelity and
//! fill rate.
//!
//! So this paints UNDER the vector graph. The shader is the light; the scene
//! on top of it is the drawing.
//!
//! # Fixed-length arrays
//!
//! A uniform buffer has a fixed size, so the bins and the nodes are arrays
//! with their own counts rather than slices. 128 bins is more than the graph
//! draws at any sane width, and 24 nodes is the band ceiling
//! ([`MAX_BANDS`](crate::eq_graph_model::MAX_BANDS)).
