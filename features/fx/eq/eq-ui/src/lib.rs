//! EQ GUI — Dioxus components for the EQ plugin.
//!
//! Hosts the EQ-specific Dioxus root component, the EQ graph viz, the
//! `nice_plug` parameter tree, and the bridging glue from `nice_plug` parameters
//! to [`fts_audio_ui`] widgets. EQ-specific visualizations live here. General-
//! purpose widgets (knobs, sliders, meters) come from [`fts_audio_ui`];
//! general layout primitives come from [`architect_ui`].
//!
//! - [`control_view`]: Pro-Q style spectrum analyzer with draggable band nodes
//! - [`eq_graph`] / [`eq_graph_painter`]: vello-rendered frequency-response graph
//! - [`faces`]: one front panel per hardware model — Pultec, SSL, API, 1073 —
//!   drawn from the shared kit in [`fts_audio_ui::hardware`]
//! - [`profile_view`]: profile-driven layouts (Pultec knob layout, etc.)
//! - [`params`]: `nice_plug` parameter tree + shared UI state
//! - [`param_adapter`]: `nice_plug` `ParamPtr` → [`fts_audio_ui::ParamHandle`]

/// Portable, and gated behind `native` until 2026-09 only because it arrived
/// alongside the vello editor. It needs nothing that editor needs — dioxus
/// and `fts_audio_ui`'s `Knob`/`ParamHandle`, both unconditional deps — and a
/// detached remote has the same eleven per-band parameters to reach as the
/// plugin does. Keeping it native-only meant the wire-driven surfaces could
/// draw a band's frequency and gain but never its dynamics.
