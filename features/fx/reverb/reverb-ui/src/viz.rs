//! What the reverb is actually doing, painted.
//!
//! A reverb's character is its decay: how long before anything arrives, how
//! densely the early reflections pack together, and how long the tail takes to
//! fall away. `TIME 1.6s · DAMP 0.30` says none of that, and the difference
//! between a room and a hall is exactly the part a number leaves out.
//!
//! The tail is drawn against the beat grid, so "two bars of reverb" is a thing
//! the picture can say rather than a sum the player has to do.
//!
//! See [`delay_ui::viz`](../../delay/delay-ui/src/viz.rs) for the two-painter
//! arrangement these share: a vector fallback that any anyrender backend can
//! replay, and a WGSL path taken when the renderer hands over a device.
